# rundll32-gui-Druckverwaltung-Win10
This is a script to Manage the Windows 10 Network Printer with a easy GUI. It is designed for your Users.

I needed a solution for our WS 2016 TS Farm because the standard Win 2016 Printer GUI has a lot of bugs. With that as
an alternative Form it will work like a charm. I have also seen the same Printer Issuses on Windows 10.

I hope it will help you.
